<h2>Welcome to my site</h2>
<p>
This isn't in use. Just keeping the domain for future use
<p>
In between each paragraph, just use those p tags.
I like writing one sentence per line here.
But it will all just come out as one paragraph.

You can follow me on instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jewelbency">@jewelbency</a>
<p>
You can <a href="nextpage.html">link to other pages like this</a>.
<p>
Or insert an image like this:
<img src="https://sive.rs/images/kids-raft.jpg">

That's it!
