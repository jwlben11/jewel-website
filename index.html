<h2>Welcome to my Awesome Site</h2>
<p>
This is the site of the author Jewel Bency
<p>
In between each paragraph, just use those p tags.
I like writing one sentence per line here.
But it will all just come out as one paragraph.
<p>
You can read about my awesome adventures here. I do a lot of cool
shit and post it here for my readers. 
<p>
You can <a href="nextpage.html">link to other pages like this</a>.
<p>
Or insert an image like this:
<img src="https://sive.rs/images/kids-raft.jpg">
<p>
That's it!
